## THE OPPORTUNITY

### The Problem is Massive

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual home insurance claims | **$150 Billion** |
| Water damage alone | **$15 Billion** |
| Fire damage | **$11 Billion** |
| Water incidents per day | **14,000** |
| House fires per year | **344,600** |

Insurance carriers have had **consecutive years of underwriting losses** and passed **$21 billion in premium increases** to consumers since 2021.

**They are desperate for loss prevention technology.**

---

## THE VALIDATION

### This Market is Proven

| Company | What They Do | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Flo by Moen | Water monitoring only | 96% claim reduction |
| Ting | Electrical monitoring only | 80% fire prevention |
| Phyn | Water monitoring only | 99% leak claim reduction |

### Recent Acquisition

**Vivint Smart Home** → Acquired by NRG Energy for **$2.8 Billion** (2023)

Energy companies and insurers are buying home platforms.

---

## THE GAP

**Every competitor monitors ONE thing.**

- Flo = Water only
- Ting = Electrical only
- Nest Protect = Smoke only

**Nobody correlates multiple perils together.**

They miss dangerous failure cascades:
> HVAC strain → Electrical anomaly → Refrigerant leak → Water damage → Structural damage

Each system looks "normal" alone. Together, they signal disaster.

---

## I.H.P. SOLUTION

**Multi-peril correlation platform** monitoring:

- Water
- Electrical
- Structural
- HVAC
- Environmental

**One platform. All risks. Predictive alerts.**

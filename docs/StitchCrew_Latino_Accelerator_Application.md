## Section 3: Business Description

**Describe your business in 2-3 sentences:**

```
I.H.P. (Intelligent Home Protection) is a multi-peril smart home monitoring platform that prevents property damage by detecting correlated failures across water, electrical, structural, HVAC, and environmental systems. We're the first platform to correlate multiple perils simultaneously, addressing the $150 billion annual property loss crisis. Our technology integrates with Matter 1.4 smart home ecosystems and targets partnerships with insurance carriers.
```

**What problem does your business solve?**

```
American homeowners lose $150 billion annually to property damage—$15 billion from water damage alone, with 14,000 incidents per day. Current smart home solutions only monitor ONE type of risk (water OR fire OR electrical), missing dangerous cross-peril patterns.

Example: An HVAC compressor drawing excess current (electrical issue) indicates bearing failure, which causes refrigerant leak (environmental), leading to condensation backup (water damage), eventually causing foundation moisture (structural damage). Existing single-peril devices miss this cascade entirely.

Insurance carriers are desperate for solutions—they've had consecutive years of underwriting losses and passed $21 billion in premium increases to consumers since 2021. They're actively partnering with smart home companies (Nationwide + Ting, Liberty Mutual + Flo by Moen) but no solution addresses multiple perils.

I.H.P. solves this by correlating data from five sensor types to detect compound failures before catastrophic loss, reducing insurance claims by up to 96% (based on competitor single-peril results).
```

**What is your product or service?**

```
I.H.P. is a hardware + software platform consisting of:

HARDWARE: Five sensor modules that monitor different perils:
• WTR-X1: Water pressure, flow, and moisture
• ELC-X1: Electrical arc faults and power quality
• STR-X1: Structural vibration and settlement
• HVC-X1: HVAC efficiency and failure prediction
• ENV-X1: Smoke, CO, temperature, humidity

SOFTWARE: Cloud-based correlation engine that analyzes multi-sensor data to detect compound failure patterns, delivering actionable alerts to homeowners before damage occurs.

INTEGRATION: Matter 1.4 compliant, works with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Tesla Powerwall.

BUSINESS MODEL:
• Hardware: $500-800 per home (5-module kit)
• Subscription: $15-25/month for monitoring
• Insurance licensing: $3-5/month per home from carrier partners
```

## Section 4: Market & Competition

**Who are your target customers?**

```
PRIMARY: Insurance carriers seeking loss prevention solutions
• Tier 1: Nationwide, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, USAA, Chubb (already investing in smart home)
• Tier 2: Allstate, American Family, Farmers, Amica
• These carriers pay us data licensing fees while offering premium discounts to participating homeowners

SECONDARY: Homeowners (direct-to-consumer)
• 94 million US households with security systems
• 50%+ homes with at least one security camera
• Target: Premium homeowners seeking comprehensive protection

TERTIARY: Contractors (LUXX BUILDZ Tech platform)
• Multi-job site monitoring
• Labor and material tracking
• Integration with Procore, Buildertrend
```

**Who are your competitors and how are you different?**

```
COMPETITORS (Single-Peril Only):
• Flo by Moen - Water only (96% claim reduction)
• Ting/Whisker Labs - Electrical only (80% fire prevention)
• LeakBot - Water only (70% claim cost reduction)
• Phyn - Water only (99% leak claim reduction)
• Nest Protect - Smoke/CO only (reactive, not preventive)

OUR DIFFERENTIATION:
1. MULTI-PERIL CORRELATION: No competitor monitors 5 perils simultaneously or correlates cross-peril failures. We detect failure cascades they completely miss.

2. INSURANCE-GRADE DATA: Built specifically for carrier integration, not consumer-first. We provide the data quality and API access insurers need.

3. MATTER 1.4 NATIVE: Full compatibility with Tesla, Apple, Google, Amazon ecosystems while competitors use proprietary protocols.

4. CONTRACTOR PLATFORM: LUXX BUILDZ Tech extends our technology to job site monitoring—a market no competitor addresses.

5. PREVENTION-FIRST: We predict and prevent, not just detect and alert.

## Section 7: Team

**Who is on your team?**

```
FOUNDER/CEO: Eric De Loera
• Background in construction and real estate development (LUXX BUILDZ / De Loera Development)
• Hands-on experience with home systems, failure modes, and contractor workflows
• First-generation entrepreneur

ADVISORY (In Discussion):
• Hardware Engineering: Joe Hobart, EE at Kicker Audio (Stillwater, OK)
• Insurance Industry: [Building relationships with carrier contacts]

HIRING NEEDS:
• Software Engineer (embedded systems + cloud)
• Sales/Business Development (insurance industry experience)

The StitchCrew accelerator mentorship will help build out our advisory network and identify key hires.
```

**Why are you the right person to build this business?**

```
I've spent years in construction (LUXX BUILDZ / De Loera Development) seeing firsthand how homes fail and how preventable most disasters are. I've repaired water damage, fixed electrical issues, and watched families suffer losses that better technology could have prevented.

That hands-on experience is exactly what's missing from current smart home companies. Engineers at Ring and Nest have never crawled under a house to fix a leaking pipe or traced an electrical fault through a wall. They build consumer gadgets, not prevention systems.

I understand:
• How building systems interact and fail together
• What contractors need on job sites
• How insurance claims devastate working families
• The Oklahoma market and community

As a Hispanic entrepreneur, I'm also motivated to prove that tech innovation can happen in Oklahoma, not just Silicon Valley. I want to create quality tech jobs in OKC and build generational wealth in my community.

The StitchCrew program will accelerate my business fundamentals while I focus on the technical and market execution I already understand.
```

## Section 8: Goals

**What do you hope to get out of the StitchCrew accelerator?**

```
1. FINANCIAL FUNDAMENTALS: Strengthen my financial modeling, projections, and investor-ready materials. I know the technology and market—I need to sharpen my finance skills.

2. CAPITAL ACCESS: Connections to investors, grant programs, and funding sources beyond what I can find on my own. The $15,000 grant is valuable, but introductions to larger capital sources are equally important.

3. MENTORSHIP: Guidance from experienced entrepreneurs who've scaled hardware + software businesses. I need advisors who've navigated manufacturing, supply chain, and enterprise sales.

4. NETWORK: Connections to other Latino entrepreneurs, potential partners, and the broader OKC innovation ecosystem. I'm building alone right now—I need a community.

5. ACCOUNTABILITY: The 8-week structure will push me to hit milestones and make progress I might defer when working solo.

6. CREDIBILITY: Graduating from StitchCrew adds legitimacy when approaching insurance carriers and investors who may otherwise dismiss a solo founder from Oklahoma.
```

**Where do you see your business in 1 year? 3 years?**

1 YEAR (End of 2025):
• Working prototype deployed in 25-50 homes in OKC metro
• First insurance carrier pilot partnership signed
• SBIR Phase I grant received ($274K)
• 3-5 person team in place

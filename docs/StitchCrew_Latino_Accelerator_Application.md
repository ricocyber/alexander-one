## Section 3: Business Description

**Describe your business in 2-3 sentences:**

```
Alexander One is a home disaster prevention platform that responds in under 3 seconds to shut off water and gas when it detects leaks, fires, or hazards. We're the only platform that prevents—not just detects—the $50 billion in annual U.S. property damage. With 2 patents filed (101 claims) and working firmware, we license our technology to Samsung, LG, and Whirlpool for integration into their appliances.
```

**What problem does your business solve?**

```
American homeowners lose $50 billion annually to water damage, fires, gas leaks, and foundation failures. 93% of it is preventable.

THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM:
• $13 billion in water damage claims per year
• $25 billion in fire damage claims per year
• $2.4 billion in gas leak incidents per year
• Every 23 seconds, a fire department responds to a home fire

CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE TOO SLOW:
Existing smart home devices respond in 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done:
• Flo by Moen: Water only, 30+ second response
• Nest Protect: Smoke/CO only, detection after event starts
• Ring: Security only, no loss prevention

These single-peril solutions detect problems AFTER they happen. They notify you faster that you're losing money—they don't prevent the loss.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DESPERATE:
• Carriers have consecutive years of underwriting losses
• $21 billion in premium increases passed to consumers
• Proven results: Flo (96% claim reduction), but only for water

NO SOLUTION EXISTS THAT:
• Responds fast enough to prevent damage (under 3 seconds)
• Covers multiple perils (water + fire + gas + foundation)
• Automatically shuts off utilities before catastrophic loss

Alexander One fills this gap. We don't just detect—we prevent.
```

**What is your product or service?**

```
Alexander One is a hardware + software platform that detects home hazards and responds in under 3 seconds—fast enough to actually prevent damage.

WHAT WE DO:
| Hazard | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Water leak detected | Valve closes in 800ms |
| Gas leak detected | Supply cut, fire dept alerted |
| Stove unattended | Graduated warnings → auto shutoff |
| Foundation shift | 0.001° tilt detection |
| HVAC degradation | Predicts failure before breakdown |

HARDWARE (Working Prototype):
• ESP32-S3 microcontroller
• MLX90614 thermal sensor (fire detection)
• MQ-6 gas detection
• MQ-2 smoke detection
• PIR motion sensing
• MQTT cloud connectivity
• 508 lines of firmware, compiled and working

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
• US Provisional 63/934,524 — Smart Home + Tesla Powerwall Coordination (Filed Dec 9, 2025, 20 claims)
• US Provisional 63/948,182 — AI-Powered Hazard Detection (Filed Dec 24, 2025, 81 claims)
• Total: 101 patent claims

BUSINESS MODEL:
License to appliance manufacturers. Samsung, LG, Whirlpool build Alexander One technology into every stove, water heater, generator. We collect royalties on millions of units.
• $2-5 royalty per unit = $50M-$150M annually
```

## Section 4: Market & Competition

**Who are your target customers?**

```
PRIMARY: Appliance Manufacturers (B2B Licensing)

Target licensees for Alexander One technology:
• Samsung: 10M+ ranges/year, smart home ecosystem
• LG: 8M+ appliances/year, ThinQ platform
• Whirlpool: 15M+ appliances/year, largest US manufacturer
• Generac: 3M+ generators, Tesla Powerwall competitor

These manufacturers need differentiated safety features. They pay licensing fees ($2-5 per unit) to embed our technology.

SECONDARY: Insurance Carriers (B2B Data)

Major carriers investing in smart home loss prevention:
• Tier 1: Nationwide, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, USAA, Chubb
• Data licensing fees for claim reduction insights

TERTIARY: Direct to Consumer
• 140 million US homes
• Premium homeowners seeking comprehensive protection
• Insurance premium discounts drive adoption
```

**Who are your competitors and how are you different?**

```
COMPETITORS (Single-Peril, Slow Response):
| Company | Peril | Response Time | Exit |
|---------|-------|---------------|------|
| Flo by Moen | Water only | 30-60 sec | Acquired by Moen |
| Ting/Whisker Labs | Electrical only | Detection | $26M+ raised |
| Phyn | Water only | 30+ sec | Belkin/Uponor |
| Nest Protect | Smoke/CO only | Detection | Google ($3.2B) |
| Ring | Security only | N/A | Amazon ($1.15B) |

ALEXANDER ONE DIFFERENTIATION:

1. SPEED: Under 3 Seconds
Competitors respond in 30-60 seconds. We respond in under 3. That's the difference between a wet floor and $50,000 in damage.

2. MULTI-PERIL COVERAGE
Only platform addressing water + fire + gas + foundation + stove in one system.

3. AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF
We don't just detect and notify—we actually shut off water and gas automatically.

4. 101 PATENT CLAIMS
Two US provisionals filed protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else.

5. LICENSING MODEL
We don't compete with Samsung, LG, Whirlpool—we license to them.

6. FOUNDER ADVANTAGE
10+ years as a licensed general contractor. I've rebuilt fire-damaged homes and water-damaged apartments. I know where problems start.

## Section 7: Team

**Who is on your team?**

```
FOUNDER/CEO: Eric De Loera

BACKGROUND:
• Licensed general contractor, 10+ years experience
• Built and repaired homes across Oklahoma
• Rebuilt fire-damaged homes, repaired water-damaged apartments
• First-generation Hispanic entrepreneur
• Oklahoma City native

SOLO FOUNDER ADVANTAGE:
• Built working prototype alone (firmware, hardware, cloud)
• Filed 2 patents alone (101 claims)
• No equity diluted to technical co-founder
• Full decision-making control

HIRING PLAN (Post-Funding):
• Hardware engineer (contract)
• Sales/BD (appliance industry experience)
• Marketing (D2C growth)

The StitchCrew accelerator mentorship will help build advisory network and identify key hires.
```

**Why are you the right person to build this business?**

```
I spent 10 years as a licensed general contractor rebuilding fire-damaged homes and repairing water-damaged apartments. I know where problems start.

I've seen:
• Water leaks that destroy drywall and foundations
• Electrical faults that cause fires
• HVAC failures that cascade into bigger problems
• The financial devastation these cause to families

Engineers at Ring, Nest, and Flo have never crawled under a house to fix a leak or traced an electrical fault through a wall. They build consumer gadgets based on theory.

I build solutions based on reality.

That's why I filed 2 patents with 101 claims in 2 weeks. That's why I built working firmware alone. That's why I know this technology needs to exist.

As a Hispanic entrepreneur in Oklahoma, I'm proving that tech innovation happens here—not just Silicon Valley. I want to create quality tech jobs in OKC and build generational wealth in my community.

Ring started in a garage. Sold to Amazon for $1.15B.
Nest started with one thermostat. Sold to Google for $3.2B.
Flo started with a water valve. Moen acquired them.

I'm building the next one. In Oklahoma.

## Section 2: Company Overview

**Company Name:**
```
Cielo Azul LLC (dba I.H.P. - Intelligent Home Protection)
```

**Website:**
```
ihp-home.io (Under Development)
```

**One-line description of your company:**

```
I.H.P. is a multi-peril smart home platform that prevents property damage by correlating water, electrical, structural, HVAC, and environmental sensor data to detect failure cascades before catastrophic loss.
```

**What stage is your company?**
```
Pre-revenue / Prototype development
```

**Industry:**
```
Smart Home Technology / InsurTech / IoT
```

## Section 3: The Problem

**What problem are you solving? (100-200 words)**

```
American homeowners lose $150 billion annually to property damage. Water damage alone costs $15 billion per year—that's 14,000 incidents every single day. The average claim is $14,000-$15,400, enough to devastate a family's finances.

Current smart home solutions are fragmented and incomplete:
• Flo by Moen monitors water only
• Ting monitors electrical only
• Nest Protect detects smoke/CO only

These single-peril devices miss dangerous cross-system failures. Example: An aging HVAC compressor draws excess current (electrical), indicating bearing failure. This leads to refrigerant leak (environmental), causing condensation backup (water), eventually damaging the foundation (structural). Current devices detect NONE of this cascade until it's too late.

Insurance carriers are desperate for solutions—they've had consecutive years of underwriting losses and passed $21 billion in premium increases to consumers since 2021. They're actively partnering with smart home companies but no existing solution addresses multiple perils in a correlated way.

The problem is clear: incomplete monitoring leads to preventable disasters.

## Section 4: The Solution

**What is your solution? (100-200 words)**

```
I.H.P. (Intelligent Home Protection) is the first platform to correlate multiple home perils simultaneously.

HARDWARE: Five sensor modules monitoring different risk categories:
• Water: Pressure, flow, moisture detection
• Electrical: Arc faults, power quality, voltage anomalies
• Structural: Vibration, tilt, settlement
• HVAC: Compressor health, efficiency degradation
• Environmental: Smoke, CO, temperature, humidity

SOFTWARE: Cloud-based correlation engine that analyzes multi-sensor data streams to identify compound failure patterns. When the system detects that an electrical anomaly + HVAC strain + humidity change are happening together, it alerts the homeowner AND provides specific guidance—not just "something's wrong."

INTEGRATION: Built on Matter 1.4 protocol with Thread mesh networking. Works with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Tesla Powerwall out of the box.

BUSINESS MODEL:
• Hardware sales ($500-800 per home)
• Monthly monitoring subscription ($15-25/month)
• Insurance data licensing ($3-5/month per home from carrier partners)

Competitor single-peril devices achieve 70-99% claim reduction. By correlating all five perils, I.H.P. can exceed these results while catching failures that single-peril devices miss entirely.

## Section 6: Competition

**Who are your competitors and how are you different?**

```
COMPETITORS:
| Company | Focus | Claim Reduction | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-----|
| Flo by Moen | Water only | 96% | No electrical/structural |
| Ting | Electrical only | 80% | No water/HVAC |
| LeakBot | Water only | 70% | No prediction |
| Phyn | Water only | 99% | No correlation |
| Nest Protect | Smoke/CO | N/A | Reactive only |

I.H.P. DIFFERENTIATION:

1. MULTI-PERIL CORRELATION
Only platform monitoring 5 perils simultaneously. We detect failure cascades competitors miss entirely.

2. INSURANCE-GRADE DATA
Built for carrier integration from day one. Competitors built consumer products first, retrofit for insurance later.

3. MATTER 1.4 NATIVE
Full ecosystem compatibility (Tesla, Apple, Google, Amazon) while competitors use proprietary protocols.

4. PREVENTION-FIRST
Predictive algorithms identify problems before failure, not just detect after the fact.

5. CONTRACTOR PLATFORM
LUXX BUILDZ Tech extends to job sites—no competitor addresses this market.

## Section 7: Team

**Tell us about your team:**

```
FOUNDER: Eric De Loera
• CEO & Product Lead
• Background: Construction and real estate development (LUXX BUILDZ / De Loera Development)
• Hands-on experience with home systems, failure modes, and contractor workflows
• First-generation Hispanic entrepreneur in Oklahoma City

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FOUNDER:
I've spent years building and repairing homes. I've seen how water leaks destroy drywall, how electrical faults cause fires, how HVAC failures cascade into bigger problems. Engineers at Ring and Nest have never crawled under a house or traced a fault through a wall.

I understand:
• How building systems interact and fail together
• What contractors actually need on job sites
• How insurance claims devastate working families
• The Oklahoma market and community

BUILDING THE TEAM:
• Hardware Engineer: In discussion with Joe Hobart (EE, Kicker Audio)
• Software Engineer: Actively recruiting
• Insurance Advisor: Building carrier relationships

gBETA mentorship will help identify and attract key team members.

## Section 8: Ask

**What do you want to get out of gBETA?**

```
1. CUSTOMER DISCOVERY VALIDATION
I've done market research—gBETA will push me to validate assumptions through direct customer conversations with homeowners and insurance contacts.

2. BUSINESS MODEL REFINEMENT
Hardware + subscription + data licensing is complex. I need help optimizing pricing, unit economics, and go-to-market sequencing.

3. PITCH DEVELOPMENT
I know my technology. I need help translating that into a compelling 2-minute pitch for investors and partners.

4. MENTOR NETWORK
Access to entrepreneurs who've built hardware companies, navigated manufacturing, and sold to enterprise customers (insurance carriers).

5. PATHWAY TO GENER8TOR
The $100K gener8tor investment accelerator is a logical next step. gBETA demonstrates I'm serious and coachable.

6. OKC ECOSYSTEM CONNECTIONS
I'm building in Oklahoma, not Silicon Valley. I need deep connections to the local startup community, investors, and resources.
```

**What's your biggest challenge right now?**

```
CAPITAL + CREDIBILITY GAP

I have the technical vision, market understanding, and real estate collateral—but I'm a solo founder with a new LLC and no startup track record. This creates two connected challenges:

1. FUNDING: Traditional lenders won't touch a new tech LLC. Grant programs require track record. I need non-dilutive capital to build a prototype without giving away equity too early.

2. CREDIBILITY: Insurance carriers and investors see a solo founder from Oklahoma and wonder if I can execute. I need external validation—accelerator completion, advisor endorsements, pilot results.

gBETA solves #2 directly (credibility through program completion and mentor relationships) and helps #1 indirectly (connections to capital sources, pathway to gener8tor $100K investment).

I'm also pursuing SBIR federal grants ($274K Phase I) and minority business programs (Comcast RISE, StitchCrew) to address the funding gap.
```

---

## Section 9: Commitment

**Why do you want to join gBETA specifically?**

```
Three reasons:

1. NO EQUITY
I'm protective of my cap table this early. gBETA gives me accelerator benefits without dilution. That's rare and valuable.

2. PATHWAY TO GENER8TOR
The $100K gener8tor investment accelerator is one of the best opportunities in Oklahoma. gBETA is the proving ground—if I perform well, I have a clear path to that investment.

3. LOCAL FOCUS
I'm building in Oklahoma, for Oklahoma first. gBETA OKC understands this market, has local mentors, and connects to the OKC innovation ecosystem. I don't need Silicon Valley advice—I need OKC advice.

I'm fully committed to the 7-week program. I'll show up prepared, coachable, and ready to work.
```

**Are you able to commit to the full 7-week program?**

```
Yes. I'm 100% committed to attending all sessions, completing assignments, and fully engaging with mentors and cohort members. Building I.H.P. is my primary focus—I'll structure my schedule around gBETA requirements.

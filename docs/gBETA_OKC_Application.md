```
alexanderone.io (Under Development)
```

**One-line description of your company:**

Alexander One is a home disaster prevention platform that responds in under 3 seconds to shut off water and gas when it detects leaks, fires, or hazards—preventing the $50 billion in annual U.S. property damage that current products miss.
```

**What stage is your company?**
```
Pre-revenue / Working prototype / 2 patents filed (101 claims)
```

**Industry:**
```
Smart Home Technology / InsurTech / IoT
```

## Section 3: The Problem

**What problem are you solving? (100-200 words)**

```
American homeowners lose $50 billion annually to water damage, fires, gas leaks, and foundation failures. 93% of it is preventable.

THE SCALE:
• $13 billion in water damage claims per year
• $25 billion in fire damage claims per year
• $2.4 billion in gas leak incidents per year
• Every 23 seconds, a fire department responds to a home fire

CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE TOO SLOW:
Existing smart home devices respond in 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done:
• Flo by Moen: Water only, 30+ second response
• Nest Protect: Smoke/CO only, detection after event starts
• Ring: Security only, no loss prevention

These single-peril solutions detect problems AFTER they happen. They notify you faster that you're losing money—they don't prevent the loss.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DESPERATE:
• Carriers have consecutive years of underwriting losses
• $21 billion in premium increases passed to consumers
• Proven results: Flo (96% claim reduction), but only for water

No existing solution responds fast enough to prevent damage. That's the problem.
```

## Section 4: The Solution

**What is your solution? (100-200 words)**

```
Alexander One is a hardware + software platform that detects home hazards and responds in under 3 seconds—fast enough to actually prevent damage.

WHAT WE DO:
| Hazard | Response |

• US Provisional 63/948,182 — AI-Powered Hazard Detection (Filed Dec 24, 2025, 81 claims)
• Total: 101 patent claims

BUSINESS MODEL:
License to appliance manufacturers. Samsung, LG, Whirlpool build our technology into appliances. We collect $2-5 royalty per unit on millions of units.

## Section 6: Competition

**Who are your competitors and how are you different?**

```
COMPETITORS (Single-Peril, Slow Response):
| Company | Peril | Response Time | Exit |
|---------|-------|---------------|------|
| Flo by Moen | Water only | 30-60 sec | Acquired by Moen |
| Ting/Whisker Labs | Electrical only | Detection | $26M+ raised |
| Phyn | Water only | 30+ sec | Belkin/Uponor |
| Nest Protect | Smoke/CO only | Detection | Google ($3.2B) |
| Ring | Security only | N/A | Amazon ($1.15B) |

ALEXANDER ONE DIFFERENTIATION:

1. SPEED: Under 3 Seconds
Competitors respond in 30-60 seconds. We respond in under 3. That's the difference between a wet floor and $50,000 in damage.

2. MULTI-PERIL COVERAGE
Only platform addressing water + fire + gas + foundation + stove in one system.

3. AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF
We don't just detect and notify—we actually shut off water and gas automatically.

4. 101 PATENT CLAIMS
Two US provisionals filed protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else.

5. LICENSING MODEL
We don't compete with Samsung, LG, Whirlpool—we license to them.

6. FOUNDER ADVANTAGE
10+ years as a licensed general contractor. I've rebuilt fire-damaged homes and water-damaged apartments. I know where problems start.
```

## Section 7: Team

**Tell us about your team:**

```
FOUNDER: Eric De Loera
• CEO & Product Lead
• Licensed general contractor, 10+ years experience
• Built and repaired homes across Oklahoma
• Rebuilt fire-damaged homes, repaired water-damaged apartments
• First-generation Hispanic entrepreneur in Oklahoma City

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FOUNDER:
I spent 10 years in construction seeing how homes fail:
• Water leaks that destroy drywall and foundations
• Electrical faults that cause fires
• HVAC failures that cascade into bigger problems
• The financial devastation these cause to families

Engineers at Ring, Nest, and Flo have never crawled under a house to fix a leak or traced an electrical fault through a wall. They build consumer gadgets based on theory.

I build solutions based on reality.

That's why I filed 2 patents with 101 claims in 2 weeks. That's why I built working firmware alone. That's why I know this technology needs to exist.

SOLO FOUNDER ADVANTAGE:
• Built working prototype alone (firmware, hardware, cloud)
• Filed 2 patents alone (101 claims)
• No equity diluted to technical co-founder
• Full decision-making control

gBETA mentorship will help identify and attract key team members and advisors.

## Section 8: Ask

**What do you want to get out of gBETA?**

```
1. CUSTOMER DISCOVERY VALIDATION
I've done market research—gBETA will push me to validate assumptions through direct conversations with manufacturers and insurance contacts.

2. BUSINESS MODEL REFINEMENT
Licensing to Samsung, LG, Whirlpool is complex. I need help optimizing pricing, unit economics, and go-to-market sequencing.

3. PITCH DEVELOPMENT
I know my technology. I need help translating that into a compelling 2-minute pitch for manufacturers and investors.

4. MENTOR NETWORK
Access to entrepreneurs who've built hardware companies, navigated manufacturing, and sold to enterprise customers.

5. PATHWAY TO GENER8TOR
The $100K gener8tor investment accelerator is a logical next step. gBETA demonstrates I'm serious and coachable.

6. OKC ECOSYSTEM CONNECTIONS
I'm building in Oklahoma, not Silicon Valley. I need deep connections to the local startup community, investors, and resources.
```

**What's your biggest challenge right now?**

```
CAPITAL FOR CERTIFICATION + DEMOS

I have:
• 2 patents filed (101 claims)
• Working prototype
• 44-74% gross margins
• Clear business model (licensing)

I need:
• UL/FCC/ETL certification ($75K)
• Professional demo units for Samsung, LG, Whirlpool meetings
• Travel to manufacturer headquarters

gBETA helps in two ways:
1. CREDIBILITY: Manufacturers take me more seriously as a gBETA graduate with gener8tor backing
2. CAPITAL ACCESS: Pathway to gener8tor $100K + connections to other funding sources

I'm also pursuing:
• i2E Bridge2 ($50K at completion)
• OMFA investment
• StitchCrew grant ($15K)
• OCAST SSBCI programs
```

---

## Section 9: Commitment

**Why do you want to join gBETA specifically?**

```
Three reasons:

1. NO EQUITY
I'm protective of my cap table this early. gBETA gives me accelerator benefits without dilution. That's rare and valuable.

2. PATHWAY TO GENER8TOR
The $100K gener8tor investment accelerator is one of the best opportunities in Oklahoma. gBETA is the proving ground—if I perform well, I have a clear path to that investment.

3. LOCAL FOCUS
I'm building in Oklahoma, for Oklahoma first. gBETA OKC understands this market, has local mentors, and connects to the OKC innovation ecosystem.

Ring started in a garage. Sold to Amazon for $1.15B.
Nest started with one thermostat. Sold to Google for $3.2B.
Flo started with a water valve. Moen acquired them.

I'm building the next one. In Oklahoma. gBETA is where it starts.
```

**Are you able to commit to the full 7-week program?**

```
Yes. I'm 100% committed to attending all sessions, completing assignments, and fully engaging with mentors and cohort members. Building Alexander One is my primary focus—I'll structure my schedule around gBETA requirements.
```

## EMAIL 1: Cold Outreach to Loss Prevention / Underwriting VP

**Subject Line Options (pick one):**
- 96% reduction in water claims - pilot opportunity
- State Farm & Farmers are doing this - you should too
- [Company Name] loss prevention partnership inquiry

---

**To:** VP of Loss Prevention / Chief Underwriting Officer
**From:** Eric De Loera, PergoLuxx Construction

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [Oklahoma Farm Bureau / Texas Farm Bureau] is one of the most respected regional carriers in [state], and I believe we can help you significantly reduce property claims.

**The problem you're facing:**
Water damage alone costs insurers $13 billion annually. Fire adds another $11 billion. Your policyholders are one burst pipe or unattended stove away from a $12,000+ claim.

**What's already working:**
- State Farm + Ting: 80% reduction in electrical fire claims
- Farmers + Moen Flo: Now *requiring* water shutoff devices in Bay Area
- Nationwide: Giving free leak detectors in 38 states

**What we built:**
ALEXANDER one.1 is a multi-peril smart home protection platform that combines water leak detection, gas leak detection, smoke/CO monitoring, AND automatic stove shutoff in one system. It's not just detection—it's automatic prevention.

**Why this matters for you:**
- Automatic water shutoff before damage occurs (96% claim reduction proven)
- Stove safety monitoring (33% of home fires are unattended cooking)
- Single integration vs. 4 separate vendor relationships
- Built for Texas/Oklahoma conditions (propane support, extreme weather resilience)

**The ask:**
I'd like 15 minutes to show you the system and discuss a pilot program with 50-100 of your highest-risk policyholders. If it doesn't reduce claims, you've lost nothing. If it does, you've found a competitive advantage.

Are you available for a brief call next week?

Best,
**Eric De Loera**

## EMAIL 2: Shorter Version (If No Response After 5 Days)

**Subject:** Following up - 15 min on loss prevention tech

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my note about ALEXANDER one.1.

The short version: State Farm, Farmers, and Nationwide are all investing heavily in smart home loss prevention. We built a platform that does water, gas, fire, AND stove safety in one system.

Happy to share a 5-minute demo video if a call doesn't work.

Worth a conversation?

— Eric

## EMAIL 3: LinkedIn Connection Request Note

**Note (300 character limit):**

Hi [First Name] - I lead loss prevention tech at PergoLuxx. We built a multi-peril platform (water, gas, fire, stove safety) that's getting interest from regional carriers. Would love to connect and share what we're seeing in the market. - Eric

## EMAIL 4: To Innovation / Technology Officer

**Subject:** Smart home loss prevention - partnership inquiry

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] has been proactive about [recent initiative / technology adoption / customer experience]. I'm reaching out about a potential technology partnership.

**What we built:**
ALEXANDER one.1 is a unified smart home protection platform:
- Water leak detection + automatic shutoff
- Gas leak detection + valve control
- Smoke/CO monitoring
- Stove safety (heat + motion + timer = auto-shutoff)
- Real-time utility monitoring
- Matter 1.4 / Thread mesh networking (2025 standard)
- Edge AI for predictive alerts

**Why one platform matters:**
Your competitors are cobbling together 3-4 vendor relationships (Flo for water, Ting for electrical, Ring for security). We're the integrated solution—one device, one integration, complete home protection.

**Current traction:**
- Fully functional prototype
- Patent-pending stove safety system
- Built for regional conditions (propane, extreme weather, Spanish language support)

I'd welcome 20 minutes to demo the platform and explore whether a pilot program makes sense for [Company Name].

Best,
**Eric De Loera**

## EMAIL 5: Referral Request (If You Know Someone at the Company)

**Subject:** [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

---

Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Contact Name] mentioned you're the right person to talk to about loss prevention technology at [Company Name].

We built ALEXANDER one.1—a smart home platform that combines water, gas, fire, and stove safety monitoring with automatic shutoff capabilities. State Farm and Farmers are already requiring similar tech in high-risk areas.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call? I'd love to show you what we've built and see if there's a fit for a pilot program.

Thanks,
Eric

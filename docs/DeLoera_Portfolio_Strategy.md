## Growth Strategy Options

### Option A: Conservative HELOC Strategy
**Risk Level:** Low
**Timeline:** 12-24 months to next property

1. Open HELOC on one or both properties (60-70% LTV)
2. Available credit: ~$185,000 - $290,000
3. Use for 20-25% down payment on rental property
4. Target: $150K-$200K rental property
5. Cash flow from new rental pays HELOC interest

**Pros:** Keep current homes, low monthly obligation
**Cons:** Slower growth, variable HELOC rates

---

### Option B: Cash-Out Refinance
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium
**Timeline:** 6-12 months to next property

1. Cash-out refi on Blackwelder (your property)
2. Pull 70-75% LTV = ~$100,000 - $120,000 cash
3. New mortgage payment: ~$700-$800/month
4. Use cash for 2-3 rental down payments

**Pros:** Fixed rate, lump sum for investing
**Cons:** Adds monthly payment to primary residence

---

### Option C: BRRRR Method
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Timeline:** 3-6 months per property

**B**uy - **R**ehab - **R**ent - **R**efinance - **R**epeat

1. Use HELOC for all-cash purchase of distressed property ($80K-$100K)
2. Rehab for $20K-$30K
3. Rent at market rate
4. Refinance at new appraised value (pull cash back out)
5. Repeat with recycled capital

**Target Markets in OKC:**
- Del City
- Midwest City
- South OKC
- Spencer
- Valley Brook

**Pros:** Fastest equity building, forces appreciation
**Cons:** Requires renovation knowledge, more hands-on

---

### Option D: House Hack (If Applicable)
**Risk Level:** Low
**Timeline:** Immediate

If Blackwelder has space:
- Add ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) in backyard
- Convert garage to rental unit
- Rent spare rooms

**Potential Added Income:** $500-$1,000/month

## Tax Advantages

### Deductions Available

- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Repairs & maintenance
- Property management fees
- Depreciation (huge tax shelter)
- Travel to properties
- Home office (if managing portfolio)

### Depreciation Example
$150,000 rental property (building value ~$120,000)
- Annual depreciation: $120,000 / 27.5 years = **$4,364/year**
- This is "paper loss" that reduces taxable income

### 1031 Exchange
Sell property → reinvest in larger property → defer ALL capital gains taxes

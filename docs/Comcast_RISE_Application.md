## Section 3: Business Description

**What does your business do? (150-200 words)**

```
Cielo Azul LLC is developing I.H.P. (Intelligent Home Protection), a revolutionary smart home platform that prevents property damage before it happens.

Unlike existing solutions that monitor only one risk (water OR fire OR electrical), I.H.P. is the first platform to correlate multiple perils simultaneously—water leaks, electrical faults, structural issues, HVAC failures, and environmental hazards—to detect dangerous failure patterns before catastrophic loss occurs.

The problem is massive: American homeowners suffer $150 billion in property damage annually. Water damage alone costs $15 billion per year, with 14,000 incidents happening every single day. Insurance carriers are desperate for solutions—they've passed $21 billion in premium increases to consumers since 2021.

Our technology uses Matter 1.4-compliant sensors with Thread mesh networking, designed to integrate seamlessly with Tesla Powerwall, Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa. We're targeting partnerships with major insurance carriers who already offer 5-35% premium discounts for smart home devices.

Based in Oklahoma City, we're building a company that protects families and their most valuable asset—their home.

## Section 4: Impact Questions

**How has your business impacted your community? (100-150 words)**

```
As a Hispanic entrepreneur in Oklahoma City, I'm building I.H.P. to protect working families who can least afford catastrophic home damage. A single water leak averaging $14,000 can devastate a family's finances and potentially lead to displacement or foreclosure.

My background in construction (LUXX BUILDZ / De Loera Development) showed me firsthand how preventable most home disasters are—if homeowners had the right technology and information. But current smart home solutions are fragmented, expensive, and inaccessible to middle-income families.

I.H.P. will make comprehensive home protection affordable and accessible. By partnering with insurance carriers, we can offer devices at reduced cost while lowering premiums for participating homeowners. This creates a win-win: families save money on insurance AND avoid devastating losses.

My goal is to prevent 10,000 home disasters in Oklahoma within our first five years.
```

**How would the Comcast RISE grant help your business? (100-150 words)**

```
The $10,000 Comcast RISE grant would accelerate three critical areas:

1. PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT: Fund initial sensor hardware for our first 10-home pilot program in Oklahoma City, proving our multi-peril correlation technology works in real-world conditions.

2. MARKETING & AWARENESS: Build our digital presence to attract insurance carrier partners and early adopter homeowners. We need professional marketing materials to compete with established players like Flo by Moen and Ting.

3. TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE: Establish cloud computing infrastructure for our data platform, which will process sensor data and deliver actionable alerts to homeowners.

The marketing services and technology upgrades from Comcast RISE are equally valuable—we need professional creative assets and reliable connectivity to demonstrate credibility to insurance industry partners who will evaluate us against well-funded competitors.

This grant represents seed funding that positions us for larger SBIR federal grants ($274,000+) currently in application.

## Section 5: Future Goals

**Where do you see your business in 2-3 years? (100-150 words)**

```
By 2027, I.H.P. will be:

PROTECTING 50,000+ HOMES across Oklahoma and Texas through partnerships with regional insurance carriers, with expansion plans for nationwide deployment.

GENERATING $5M+ ANNUAL REVENUE through hardware sales ($500-800 per home), monthly monitoring subscriptions ($15-25/month), and insurance data licensing fees ($3-5/month per monitored home).

EMPLOYING 25-40 PEOPLE in Oklahoma City, including hardware engineers, software developers, customer support, and sales—creating quality tech jobs in our community.

PARTNERED WITH 5+ INSURANCE CARRIERS including regional players and potentially national carriers like Nationwide, State Farm, or Liberty Mutual—all of whom have active smart home programs seeking solutions like ours.

POSITIONED FOR ACQUISITION or growth investment, following the path of Vivint (acquired by NRG for $2.8 billion) and establishing Oklahoma City as an insurtech innovation hub.
```

## Section 6: Challenges

**What challenges is your business currently facing? (100-150 words)**

```
Our primary challenges are:

1. CAPITAL ACCESS: As a new LLC with no credit history, traditional business loans are difficult. We have real estate collateral ($140K+ property owned free and clear) but need non-dilutive funding to maintain equity while developing our prototype. We're actively pursuing SBIR federal grants and minority business programs.

2. TECHNICAL TALENT: Finding experienced hardware engineers in Oklahoma City is challenging. We're in discussions with a potential engineering partner but need funding to formalize the relationship.

3. MARKET TIMING: The insurance industry is actively seeking smart home solutions NOW—carriers have had consecutive years of underwriting losses. We need to move quickly before larger competitors (Amazon/Ring, Google/Nest) dominate the insurance-grade monitoring space.

4. CREDIBILITY: As a startup, we need professional marketing presence to be taken seriously by insurance carrier partners who are used to working with established vendors.

## Section 7: Additional Information

**Is there anything else you'd like us to know? (Optional, 50-100 words)**

```
I'm a first-generation entrepreneur from a working-class Hispanic family. I've built my construction business (LUXX BUILDZ) from the ground up, learning every trade hands-on. Now I'm applying that same work ethic to technology innovation.

I.H.P. represents the intersection of my construction expertise and emerging smart home technology. I understand how homes fail because I've built and repaired them. That practical knowledge, combined with cutting-edge IoT technology, gives I.H.P. a unique competitive advantage.

Oklahoma needs more Hispanic-led tech companies. I intend to build one.

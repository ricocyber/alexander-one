## Section 3: Business Overview

**Describe your company in one sentence:**

```
Alexander One is a home disaster prevention platform that responds in under 3 seconds to shut off water and gas when it detects leaks, fires, or hazards—preventing the $50 billion in annual U.S. property damage that current products miss.
```

**What industry are you in?**

```
Smart Home Technology / InsurTech / Internet of Things (IoT)
```

**What problem does your company solve? (200-300 words)**

```
American homeowners lose $50 billion annually to water damage, fires, gas leaks, and foundation failures. 93% of it is preventable.

THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM:
• $13 billion in water damage claims per year
• $25 billion in fire damage claims per year
• $2.4 billion in gas leak incidents per year
• $10+ billion in foundation failures per year
• Every 23 seconds, a fire department responds to a home fire

CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE TOO SLOW:
Existing smart home devices respond in 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done:
• Flo by Moen: Water only, 30+ second response
• Nest Protect: Smoke/CO only, detection after event starts
• Ring: Security only, no loss prevention

These single-peril solutions detect problems AFTER they happen. They don't prevent damage—they just notify you faster that you're losing money.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DESPERATE:
• Carriers have had consecutive years of underwriting losses
• $21 billion in premium increases passed to consumers (2021-2024)
• Carriers actively investing in smart home loss prevention
• Proven results: Flo (96% claim reduction), but only for water

WHAT'S MISSING:
No existing solution:
• Responds fast enough to prevent damage (under 3 seconds)
• Covers multiple perils (water + fire + gas + foundation)
• Automatically shuts off utilities before catastrophic loss

Alexander One fills this gap. We don't just detect—we prevent.
```

**Describe your product or service: (200-300 words)**

```
Alexander One is a hardware + software platform that detects home hazards and responds in under 3 seconds—fast enough to actually prevent damage.

WHAT WE DO:

| Hazard | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Water leak detected | Valve closes in 800ms |
| Gas leak detected | Supply cut, fire dept alerted |
| Stove unattended | Graduated warnings → auto shutoff |
| Foundation shift | 0.001° tilt detection, early warning |
| HVAC degradation | Predicts failure before breakdown |

HARDWARE (Working Prototype):
• ESP32-S3 microcontroller
• MLX90614 thermal sensor (fire detection)
• MQ-6 gas detection
• MQ-2 smoke detection
• PIR motion sensing
• MQTT cloud connectivity
• 508 lines of firmware, compiled and working

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:
• US Provisional 63/934,524 — Smart Home + Tesla Powerwall Coordination (Filed Dec 9, 2025, 20 claims)
• US Provisional 63/948,182 — AI-Powered Hazard Detection + Multi-Appliance Protection (Filed Dec 24, 2025, 81 claims)
• Total: 101 patent claims protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else

BUSINESS MODEL:
License to appliance manufacturers. Samsung, LG, Whirlpool build Alexander One technology into every stove, water heater, generator. We collect royalties on millions of units.

• Samsung sells 10M+ ranges/year
• LG sells 8M+
• Whirlpool sells 15M+
• $2-5 royalty per unit = $50M-$150M annually

Unlike competitors who sell consumer gadgets, we license technology to the companies that already have distribution.

## Section 5: Competition & Differentiation

**Who are your competitors?**

```
DIRECT COMPETITORS (Single-Peril Smart Home):

| Company | Peril | Response Time | Exit |
|---------|-------|---------------|------|
| Flo by Moen | Water only | 30-60 sec | Acquired by Moen |
| Ting / Whisker Labs | Electrical only | Detection | $26M+ raised |
| Phyn | Water only | 30+ sec | Belkin/Uponor |
| Nest Protect | Smoke/CO only | Detection | Google ($3.2B) |
| Ring | Security only | N/A | Amazon ($1.15B) |

CRITICAL GAP:
All competitors either:
• Cover only ONE peril (water OR fire OR gas)
• Detect problems but don't prevent them
• Respond too slowly to stop damage (30-60 seconds)

No existing product responds in under 3 seconds to actually shut off utilities and prevent catastrophic loss.
```

**How are you different?**

```
ALEXANDER ONE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:

1. SPEED: Under 3 Seconds
Competitors respond in 30-60 seconds. We respond in under 3. That's the difference between a wet floor and $50,000 in damage.

2. MULTI-PERIL COVERAGE
Only platform addressing water + fire + gas + foundation + stove in one system. Competitors do single-peril only.

3. AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF
We don't just detect and notify—we actually shut off water and gas automatically. Prevention, not detection.

4. 101 PATENT CLAIMS
Two US provisionals filed with 101 claims protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else.

5. LICENSING MODEL
We don't compete with Samsung, LG, Whirlpool—we license to them. They have distribution to 33M+ units/year. We have the technology they need.

6. FOUNDER ADVANTAGE
10+ years as a licensed general contractor. I've rebuilt fire-damaged homes and water-damaged apartments. I know where problems start. Engineers at Ring and Nest have never traced a leak through a wall. I have.

7. WORKING PROTOTYPE
508 lines of firmware, compiled and working. ESP32 + 5 sensor types integrated. MQTT cloud connectivity live. This isn't a concept—it's real.

## Section 7: Team & Capabilities

**Tell us about your founding team:**

```
FOUNDER & CEO: Eric De Loera

BACKGROUND:
• Licensed general contractor, 10+ years experience
• Built and repaired homes across Oklahoma
• Deep understanding of how home systems fail
• First-generation Hispanic entrepreneur
• Oklahoma City native

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FOUNDER:
I've spent 10 years in construction seeing how homes fail:
• Water leaks that destroy drywall and foundations
• Electrical faults that cause fires
• HVAC failures that cascade into bigger problems
• The financial devastation these cause to families

I rebuilt fire-damaged homes. I repaired water-damaged apartments. I know where pipes run, where foundations fail, what breaks first.

Engineers at Ring, Nest, and Flo have never crawled under a house to fix a leak or traced an electrical fault through a wall. They build consumer gadgets based on theory.

I build solutions based on reality.

SOLO FOUNDER ADVANTAGE:
• Built working prototype alone (firmware, hardware, cloud)
• Filed 2 patents alone (101 claims)
• No equity diluted to technical co-founder
• Full decision-making control
• Looking for advisors and contractors, not co-founders

HIRING PLAN (Post-Funding):
• Hardware engineer (contract)
• Sales/BD (appliance industry experience)
• Marketing (D2C growth)
```

## Section 9: Growth Potential

**Why is this a high-growth opportunity?**

```
1. MASSIVE MARKET IN CRISIS
$50B annual property losses. Insurance carriers losing money. $21B passed to consumers in premium increases. The industry is desperate for solutions.

2. PROVEN EXIT PATH
| Company | Exit |
|---------|------|
| Ring | $1.15B → Amazon |
| Nest | $3.2B → Google |
| Flo | Acquired → Moen |
| Vivint | $2.8B → NRG |

Alexander One does what these companies do—faster, with more coverage.

3. LICENSING LEVERAGE
We don't need to build manufacturing, distribution, or retail. Samsung, LG, Whirlpool already have it. We license technology, they handle scale.

4. 101 PATENT CLAIMS
Defensible IP protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else. Two patents covering both the Tesla Powerwall integration and the multi-appliance hazard detection.

5. REGULATORY TAILWINDS
Insurance carriers under pressure to reduce losses. California and Florida in crisis. Carriers will REQUIRE smart home devices for policy eligibility—creating mandatory adoption.

6. FIRST-MOVER
No one else is building sub-3-second multi-peril prevention. We establish the category before competitors realize the opportunity.
```

## Section 10: Why OMFA

**Why are you applying to OMFA specifically?**

```
1. OKLAHOMA-FOCUSED
I'm building in Oklahoma, for Oklahoma first. Alexander One technology will be developed here, prototyped here, and launched here. OMFA supports founders committed to building in Oklahoma—not founders who take money and move to Austin.

2. MINORITY FOUNDER SUPPORT
As a Hispanic entrepreneur, I face additional barriers to capital access. OMFA specifically addresses this through SSBCI minority set-aside funding. The program is designed for founders like me.

3. OCAST ECOSYSTEM
OMFA connects to the broader OCAST ecosystem:
• Industry Innovation grants ($50K-$500K)
• SSBCI loan programs
• Oklahoma Catalyst (SBIR support)
• gener8tor accelerator pathway

This isn't just one program—it's entry into Oklahoma's full innovation support system.

4. HIGH-GROWTH FOCUS
OMFA seeks founders with "ability to scale rapidly." Alexander One is a venture-scale opportunity:
• $50B+ addressable market
• 90%+ margins on licensing
• Network effects through manufacturer partnerships
• Acquisition precedent ($1.15B-$3.2B exits)

5. CREDIBILITY
OMFA graduation signals to manufacturers and investors that Oklahoma's innovation ecosystem has vetted this company. That credibility opens doors at Samsung, LG, and Whirlpool.

6. FOUNDER-MARKET FIT
I'm not a tech bro building an app. I'm a contractor who rebuilt damaged homes for 10 years and finally built the solution that prevents the damage in the first place. That's the story OMFA exists to support.
```

## Section 3: Business Overview

**Describe your company in one sentence:**

```
I.H.P. (Intelligent Home Protection) is a multi-peril smart home platform that prevents property damage by correlating sensor data across water, electrical, structural, HVAC, and environmental systems to detect failure cascades before catastrophic loss.
```

**What industry are you in?**

```
Smart Home Technology / InsurTech / Internet of Things (IoT)
```

**What problem does your company solve? (200-300 words)**

```
American homeowners lose $150 billion annually to property damage—a crisis that devastates families and bankrupts insurance carriers.

THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM:
• $15 billion in water damage claims per year
• $13 billion in fire damage claims per year
• 14,000 water damage incidents every single day
• 344,600 house fires annually
• Average water claim: $14,000-$15,400

CURRENT SOLUTIONS FAIL:
Existing smart home devices monitor only ONE type of risk:
• Flo by Moen: Water only
• Ting/Whisker Labs: Electrical only
• Nest Protect: Smoke/CO only

These single-peril solutions miss dangerous cross-system failures. Real example: An HVAC compressor drawing excess current (electrical anomaly) indicates bearing failure, which causes refrigerant leak (environmental hazard), leading to condensation backup (water damage), eventually causing foundation moisture (structural damage).

Current devices detect NONE of this cascade until thousands of dollars in damage has occurred.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DESPERATE:
• Carriers have had consecutive years of underwriting losses
• $21 billion in premium increases passed to consumers (2021-2024)
• Carriers actively investing in smart home loss prevention (Nationwide, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, USAA, Chubb)
• Proven results: Flo (96% claim reduction), Ting (80% fire prevention), Phyn (99% leak reduction)

But no existing solution addresses MULTIPLE perils in a CORRELATED way.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
A platform that correlates all major home perils can:
• Prevent failures that single-peril devices miss
• Deliver superior claim reduction to insurance partners
• Command premium pricing from carriers desperate for solutions
• Build a defensible data moat in a $13+ billion market
```

**Describe your product or service: (200-300 words)**

```
I.H.P. is a hardware + software platform that monitors five home perils simultaneously and correlates their data to predict compound failures.

HARDWARE - Five Sensor Modules:

WTR-X1 (Water): Monitors water pressure, flow rate, and moisture levels. Detects leaks, pipe stress, and flood risk.

ELC-X1 (Electrical): Monitors arc faults, power quality, voltage anomalies. Predicts electrical fires before they start.

STR-X1 (Structural): Monitors vibration, tilt, and settlement. Detects foundation issues, earthquake damage, impact events.

HVC-X1 (HVAC): Monitors compressor current, efficiency, temperature differentials. Predicts HVAC failure before breakdown.

ENV-X1 (Environmental): Monitors smoke, CO, temperature, humidity, air quality. Provides early warning for fire and environmental hazards.

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM:
• Nordic nRF5340 dual-core MCU (application + network processor)
• Thread mesh networking for self-healing connectivity
• Matter 1.4 protocol for ecosystem compatibility
• Works with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Tesla Powerwall

SOFTWARE - Correlation Engine:
Cloud-based AI analyzes multi-sensor data streams to identify compound failure patterns. When electrical + HVAC + humidity anomalies occur together, the system recognizes this as a failure cascade and alerts the homeowner with specific, actionable guidance.

BUSINESS MODEL:
• Hardware: $500-800 per home (5-module kit)
• Subscription: $15-25/month for monitoring
• Insurance licensing: $3-5/month per home from carrier partners

Unlike competitors who built consumer gadgets first and retrofit for insurance later, I.H.P. is built for insurance-grade data from day one.

## Section 5: Competition & Differentiation

**Who are your competitors?**

```
DIRECT COMPETITORS (Single-Peril Smart Home):

| Company | Peril | Claim Reduction | Funding |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Flo by Moen | Water | 96% | Moen (Fortune Brands) |
| Ting / Whisker Labs | Electrical | 80% | $26M+ raised |
| LeakBot / Ondo | Water | 70% | Public (UK) |
| Phyn | Water | 99% | Belkin/Uponor |
| Nest Protect | Smoke/CO | N/A | Google |

INDIRECT COMPETITORS (Smart Home Platforms):
• Ring (Amazon) - Security focus, no loss prevention
• Vivint (NRG) - Full smart home, acquired for $2.8B
• ADT - Traditional security, limited IoT

INDUSTRY CONTEXT:
All major competitors focus on SINGLE perils. None correlate multiple perils to detect compound failures. This is a fundamental gap in the market.
```

**How are you different?**

```
I.H.P. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:

1. MULTI-PERIL CORRELATION
Only platform monitoring 5 perils simultaneously and correlating their data. We catch failure cascades that single-peril devices miss entirely. No competitor does this.

2. INSURANCE-GRADE DATA
Built for carrier integration from day one. Competitors built consumer gadgets first and retrofit for insurance partnerships later. Our data quality and API architecture is designed for enterprise insurance use cases.

3. MATTER 1.4 NATIVE
Full compatibility with Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, Tesla ecosystems using the latest Matter protocol. Competitors use proprietary protocols that limit interoperability.

4. PREVENTION-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
Predictive algorithms identify problems before failure occurs. Competitors detect problems after they've started—we prevent them from happening.

5. CONTRACTOR PLATFORM (LUXX BUILDZ Tech)
Extension to construction job site monitoring. No competitor addresses this adjacent market, giving us a second revenue stream and differentiated data.

6. FOUNDER ADVANTAGE
My construction background means I understand how homes actually fail. Engineers at Ring and Nest have never traced an electrical fault through a wall or repaired water damage. I have.

## Section 7: Team & Capabilities

**Tell us about your founding team:**

```
FOUNDER & CEO: Eric De Loera

BACKGROUND:
• Construction and real estate development (LUXX BUILDZ / De Loera Development)
• Hands-on experience building and repairing homes
• Deep understanding of how home systems fail and interact
• First-generation Hispanic entrepreneur
• Oklahoma City native

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FOUNDER:
I've spent years in construction seeing how homes fail:
• Water leaks that destroy drywall and foundations
• Electrical faults that cause fires
• HVAC failures that cascade into bigger problems
• The financial devastation these cause to families

Engineers at Ring, Nest, and Flo have never crawled under a house to fix a leak or traced an electrical fault through a wall. They build consumer gadgets based on theory.

I build solutions based on reality. I know what fails, how it fails, and how failures connect to each other. That's the foundation of I.H.P.'s multi-peril correlation approach.

TEAM IN DEVELOPMENT:
• Hardware Engineer: In discussion with Joe Hobart (EE, Kicker Audio, Stillwater)
• Software Engineer: Actively recruiting
• Insurance Advisor: Building carrier relationships

HIRING PLAN:
• Q1 2025: Hardware engineer (contract or full-time)
• Q2 2025: Software engineer (cloud + embedded)
• Q3 2025: Sales/BD (insurance industry experience)

## Section 9: Growth Potential

**Why is this a high-growth opportunity?**

```
1. MASSIVE MARKET IN CRISIS
$150B annual property losses. Insurance carriers losing money. $21B passed to consumers in premium increases. The industry is desperate for solutions—and willing to pay.

2. PROVEN DEMAND
Competitors with SINGLE-peril solutions achieved:
• Flo by Moen: 96% claim reduction
• Ting: 80% fire prevention
• Phyn: 99% leak claim reduction

If single-peril devices deliver these results, multi-peril correlation will exceed them.

3. ACQUISITION PRECEDENT
NRG paid $2.8 BILLION for Vivint in 2022. The smart home + energy space is consolidating. A differentiated platform like I.H.P. is an acquisition target for:
• Insurance carriers (Nationwide, State Farm)
• Energy companies (Tesla, NRG)
• Smart home platforms (Amazon, Google)

4. REGULATORY TAILWINDS
Insurance carriers under pressure to reduce losses. California and Florida in crisis. Carriers will REQUIRE smart home devices for policy eligibility—creating mandatory adoption.

5. TECHNOLOGY TIMING
Matter 1.4 just launched (November 2024) with energy management features. The ecosystem is ready for a platform that leverages this new standard.

6. FIRST-MOVER IN MULTI-PERIL
No one else is building this. Every competitor is stuck in single-peril thinking. I.H.P. can establish the category and build defensible data advantages before competitors pivot.
```

## Section 10: Why OMFA

**Why are you applying to OMFA specifically?**

```
1. OKLAHOMA-FOCUSED
I'm building in Oklahoma, for Oklahoma first. OMFA understands this market, has local connections, and supports founders who are committed to building here—not founders who'll take the money and move to Austin.

2. MINORITY FOUNDER SUPPORT
As a Hispanic entrepreneur, I face additional barriers to capital access. OMFA specifically addresses this through SSBCI minority set-aside funding. The program is designed for founders like me.

3. OCAST ECOSYSTEM
OMFA connects to the broader OCAST ecosystem including:
• Industry Innovation grants ($50K-$500K)
• SSBCI loan programs
• Oklahoma Catalyst (SBIR support)
• gener8tor accelerator pathway

This isn't just one grant—it's entry into Oklahoma's full innovation support system.

4. HIGH-GROWTH FOCUS
OMFA seeks founders with "ability to scale rapidly." I.H.P. is a venture-scale opportunity:
• $13B+ addressable market
• 70-80% gross margins
• Network effects through carrier partnerships
• Acquisition precedent ($2.8B Vivint deal)

5. CREDIBILITY
OMFA graduation signals to insurance carriers and investors that Oklahoma's innovation ecosystem has vetted this company. That credibility is worth as much as the capital.

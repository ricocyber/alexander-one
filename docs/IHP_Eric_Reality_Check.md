# I.H.P. - WHERE YOU ACTUALLY STAND
## A Simple Guide for Eric (No Fluff Version)

## YOUR CURRENT SITUATION (BE HONEST)

**Money in the Bank:** $0 for I.H.P.

**Grants Received:** $0

**Applications Ready to Submit:**
- Comcast RISE ($25K) - application done, needs to be submitted
- StitchCrew Accelerator ($25K) - application done, needs to be submitted
- NSF SBIR Project Pitch ($274K) - application done, needs SAM.gov first

---

## GRANT STATUS - THE TRUTH

### What You HAVE Ready:
- NSF Project Pitch document (ready to copy/paste and submit)
- SBIR Application outline (needs filling in)
- Market research (done)
- Business plan (done)

### What You DON'T Have (and NEED before applying):

| Missing Item | Why It Matters | How Hard to Get |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **SAM.gov Registration** | Can't apply without it | FREE but takes 2-4 weeks |
| **D-U-N-S Number** | Required for SAM.gov | DONE: 136342147 |
| **Hardware Person (Joe?)** | NSF wants a team | You're working on this |
| **Working Prototype** | Not required for Phase I, but helps | Can't do without money |

---

## WHAT IS I.H.P. IN SIMPLE TERMS?

**The Problem You're Solving:**
- Houses get damaged by water, fire, electrical problems, HVAC failures
- This costs $27 billion per year
- Insurance companies are LOSING money (7 years straight of losses)
- They WANT solutions

**What I.H.P. Does:**
- 5 sensors that watch your house (water, electrical, structural, HVAC, smoke/CO)
- They talk to each other (this is the new part - competitors don't do this)
- They predict problems BEFORE they happen
- Insurance companies would pay for the data

**Why You Have an Advantage:**
- You actually BUILD houses (most tech people don't)
- You know how houses fail from experience
- You understand contractors (potential customers)

## YOUR REALISTIC TIMELINE

### PHASE 0: RIGHT NOW (Next 30 Days) - COSTS $0

**Week 1-2:**
1. Get your D-U-N-S number (free, online, 1-2 days)
   - Go to: dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html

2. Start SAM.gov registration (free, takes 2-4 weeks)
   - Go to: sam.gov
   - You need D-U-N-S first

3. Figure out Joe Hobart situation - is he in or out?

**Week 3-4:**
4. Submit NSF Project Pitch (free to submit)
   - Just copy/paste from your NSF_Project_Pitch_IHP.md file
   - You can do this TODAY after SAM.gov is done

5. Look at other free resources:
   - SCORE mentorship (free)
   - Local SBA office (free)
   - Oklahoma SBDC (free business help)

### PHASE 1: WAITING FOR NSF RESPONSE (1-2 Months)

**What Happens:**
- NSF reviews your pitch
- They either INVITE you to submit full proposal, or say no with feedback
- If invited, you have more time to prepare the full application

**What You Do While Waiting:**
- Keep talking to potential hardware partners
- Research component costs
- Learn more about Matter/Thread protocols (free resources online)
- Talk to insurance people if you can find any

---

### PHASE 2: IF NSF INVITES YOU (2-3 Months After Invite)

**Now It Gets Real:**
- Full proposal due
- You'll need more details on your team
- Budget needs to be specific
- This is when having a hardware person matters most

**The Money:**
- Phase I = $274,000 over 6 months
- This is NOT your money - it pays for the project
- You'd get a salary from it ($60K in your budget)
- Rest goes to contractors, equipment, etc.

## BE REAL WITH YOURSELF

### Things Working In Your Favor:
- You have real construction experience (rare in tech)
- Your market research is solid
- The problem is real ($27B real)
- Insurance companies ARE desperate
- Hispanic founder = some programs want you
- Oklahoma = less competition than coasts

### Things Working Against You:
- No money
- No hardware engineer (yet)
- No prototype
- No patent filed
- Big idea, small team

### The Hard Truth:
You're trying to build a hardware tech company with no money and no technical co-founder. This is very hard. But it's not impossible if you:

1. Get free money first (grants)
2. Find a technical partner who believes in this
3. Stay focused on the ONE thing that matters: Getting that first grant

## QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ANSWER

1. **Where did the $50K from previous grants go?**
   - If any is left, what can you use it for?

2. **Is Joe Hobart actually going to partner with you?**
   - If not, who else could you ask?
   - Could you learn basic hardware yourself? (hard but possible)

3. **Can you survive financially while building this?**
   - Do you have income from other work?
   - How long can you wait for grant money?

4. **Are you willing to do this for 2-3 years?**
   - Even Phase I takes 6+ months
   - Real company takes years
   - Is this what you want?

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**You Have:**
- A good idea with real market validation
- Professional-looking documents
- Construction knowledge competitors don't have
- A clear path forward (NSF grant)

**You Need:**
- D-U-N-S and SAM.gov registration (free, do it NOW)
- A hardware partner
- Patience (grants take months)
- Focus (stop adding features, start executing)

**First Win You're Chasing:**
NSF invites you to submit full proposal = You're being taken seriously

**That Could Lead To:**
$274,000 to actually build this thing

---

## REMEMBER

You don't need to understand all the technical stuff right now. You need to:

1. Get registered (D-U-N-S, SAM.gov)
2. Submit the pitch
3. Find your hardware person
4. Wait and prepare

That's it. Everything else is noise until those things are done.

# BRAND FOUNDATION

## Mission Statement
**Prevent home disasters before they happen.**

We protect families from the $50 billion annual devastation of water damage, fires, and gas leaks through intelligent detection and instant response.

## Vision
Every home equipped with technology that responds faster than disaster can strike.

## Brand Promise
**Under 3 seconds.** When every second counts, Alexander One responds before damage begins—not after.

| **Protection** | Families first. We prevent damage, not just detect it. |
| **Intelligence** | Multi-peril awareness. One system sees what others miss. |
| **Trust** | 101 patent claims. Engineering-backed promises. |

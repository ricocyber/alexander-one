## EMAIL 1: i2E

**To:** info@i2e.org
**Subject:** Oklahoma founder. 2 patents. No team. Need help.

Every 23 seconds, a fire department responds to a home fire.

$50 billion in damage. Every year. Exposed.

I filed 2 patents in December. 101 claims. I built working firmware. Alone.

The technology shuts off water and gas in under 3 seconds. Nothing else does this.

Ring sold for $1.15 billion. Nest sold for $3.2 billion. Flo got acquired by Moen.

I'm next. But I need help building prototypes.

20 minutes. That's all I'm asking.

## EMAIL 2: gener8tor

**To:** anita@gener8tor.com (Managing Director Anita Ly)
**Subject:** I filed 2 patents in 2 weeks. Alone.

Here's what nobody has solved:

| Problem | Annual Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Water damage | $13 billion |
| Fire damage | $25 billion |
| Gas leaks | $2.4 billion |

**93% preventable.** Zero companies prevent it. They all detect AFTER the damage starts.

I built something different.

Alexander One responds in under 3 seconds. Competitors take 30-60.

**December 9:** Filed patent #1. 20 claims.
**December 24:** Filed patent #2. 81 claims.
**Total:** 101 claims protecting technology that doesn't exist anywhere else.

Ring started in a garage. Sold to Amazon for $1.15B.
Nest started with one thermostat. Sold to Google for $3.2B.
Flo started with a water valve. Moen acquired them.

I'm building the next one. In Oklahoma.

When's the next cohort?

## EMAIL 3: OCAST

**To:** ocast@oklahoma.gov
**Subject:** $50 billion exposed. 2 Oklahoma patents. Need funding.

---

$50 billion.

That's how much Americans lose every year to water damage, fires, gas leaks, and foundation failures.

93% of it is preventable.

I spent 6 months researching this. 500+ hours. I filed 2 patents:

- **63/934,524** — Dec 9, 2025 — 20 claims
- **63/948,182** — Dec 24, 2025 — 81 claims

The technology responds in under 3 seconds. Current products take 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done.

I need funding to build prototypes and get certified.

Then I fly to Samsung, LG, Whirlpool. They license it. They build it into every appliance. Oklahoma collects royalties on millions of units.

What's the fastest path to an application?

## EMAIL 4: OK Catalyst

**To:** okcatalyst@ou.edu
**Subject:** 2 patents. Working firmware. Need SBIR help.

---

I'm not a researcher. I'm a contractor who rebuilt fire-damaged homes and water-damaged apartments for 10 years.

I know where the problems start. So I built something to stop them.

**What I have:**
- 2 U.S. patents filed (101 claims total)
- Working firmware (ESP32, sensors, cloud)
- Under 3 second response time

**What I need:**
SBIR/STTR funding to build prototypes.

I don't know how to navigate the federal grant system. That's why I'm reaching out.

Can we meet this week?

## EMAIL 5: Gradient (Tulsa)

**To:** concierge@joingradient.com
**Subject:** OKC founder. Hardware startup. 2 patents filed.

---

I built something that doesn't exist.

A system that shuts off water and gas in under 3 seconds when it detects a leak, fire, or gas hazard. Current products take 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done.

**The numbers:**
- $50 billion in annual U.S. losses (water, fire, gas, foundation)
- 93% preventable
- 2 patents filed: 101 claims total
- Working ESP32 firmware: 508 lines, compiled

I'm in OKC but Tulsa has resources I need. Looking for incubator support, mentorship, and connections to investors.

Ring sold to Amazon for $1.15B. Nest sold to Google for $3.2B. Flo got acquired by Moen.

I'm building the next one. In Oklahoma.

15 minutes?

## EMAIL 6: Cortado Ventures

**To:** (via contact form at cortado.ventures/contact-us/)
**Subject:** Hardware startup. 2 patents. $50B market. Oklahoma.

---

I'm not a software guy. I'm a contractor who rebuilt fire-damaged homes for 10 years.

I know where the problems start. So I built something to stop them.

**Alexander One:**
- Detects water leaks, gas leaks, fires, foundation shifts
- Responds in under 3 seconds (competitors take 30-60)
- 2 U.S. patents filed: 101 claims
- Working firmware: ESP32 + sensors + cloud

**The play:**
License to Samsung, LG, Whirlpool. They build it into every appliance. We collect royalties on millions of units.

$2-5 per unit = $50M-$150M annually.

Flo did water-only. Moen bought them. We do water + fire + gas + foundation.

Looking for seed funding to build prototypes and get certified.

Worth a conversation?

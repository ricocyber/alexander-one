## DESCRIBE YOUR COMPANY IN 50 CHARACTERS OR LESS
Home intelligence that predicts & prevents disasters

## WHAT DOES YOUR COMPANY DO?
Alexander One is a smart home protection platform that monitors water, air, gas, HVAC, and structural health to predict and prevent home disasters before they happen. Unlike Ring or Nest (security cameras) or Flo by Moen (water only), we're the only system that:

1. Integrates with Tesla Powerwall to coordinate emergency response
2. Uses cross-sensor AI to PREDICT failures (not just detect them)
3. Monitors foundation/structural health (no consumer product does this)
4. Provides real-time data to insurance companies for premium discounts
5. Works fully during power outages with 8-hour battery backup

When a leak is detected, we shut water off in <3 seconds while telling Tesla Powerwall to keep the sump pump running. No other system does this.

## HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
- **2 provisional patents filed** (101 total claims)
  - 63/934,524: Smart Home Infrastructure + Tesla Battery Coordination (Dec 9, 2025)
  - 63/948,182: AI-Powered Hazard Detection + Multi-Appliance Protection (Dec 24, 2025)
- **Working firmware** - 508 lines of ESP32 code with MQTT cloud connectivity, sensor integration, graduated response system
- Complete technical specifications for 7 devices
- Bill of materials finalized (44-74% gross margins)
- Potential technical co-founder under NDA (evaluating partnership)

Next: Physical prototype build and demo video (January 2026)

## HOW LONG HAVE THE FOUNDERS BEEN WORKING ON THIS?
6 months of intensive development. Filed 2 patents with 101 claims in December 2025 alone.

## WHY DID YOU PICK THIS IDEA TO WORK ON?
This is personal.

I have scars on my face from a stove fire. My brother's wife's grandmother died when her propane water heater exploded in Mexico. My grandmother's brother survived with 80% burns covering his body. My cousin's cousin lost her identity to a house fire - she's disfigured.

Four people in my family. Burns, disfigurement, death. All preventable.

I'm also a licensed Oklahoma general contractor (CIB #80007565) who has seen water damage destroy homes, foundation problems devastate families, and preventable fires ruin lives. In 8 months I built a construction company to $450K revenue with 32% margins.

The problem: Homeowners spend $13,000+ on average water damage claims. Fire claims average $84,000. Foundation repairs cost $5,000-$50,000+. These are largely PREVENTABLE with proper monitoring.

The opportunity: Tesla Powerwall is in 600,000+ homes but is completely blind to water, gas, and structural threats. NRG paid $2.8 BILLION for Vivint (security cameras). The company that builds the home intelligence layer for Tesla's energy ecosystem is worth billions.

I'm not a tech founder guessing what homes need. I've built them, repaired them, seen what breaks - and I carry the scars of what happens when protection fails.

## WHAT DOMAIN EXPERTISE DO YOU HAVE?
- **Licensed General Contractor** (Oklahoma CIB #80007565)
- **Licensed Roofing Contractor**
- **10+ years construction experience** - I know where pipes run, where foundations fail, what breaks first
- **$450K revenue in 8 months** building PergoLuxx Construction
- **$520K-600K equity** in debt-free properties
- **Bilingual** (Spanish/English) - can manage diverse teams and manufacturing relationships

I understand homes at a physical level that software engineers don't.

## HAVE YOU FORMED A COMPANY?
Yes - PergoLuxx Construction LLC (Oklahoma)
- EIN: 33-3307582
- D-U-N-S: 136342147

Will form Delaware C-Corp for Alexander One upon acceptance.

## PRODUCT

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

**Hardware:**
1. **Alexander Hub** ($799) - 7" touchscreen brain with built-in air quality sensors, edge AI, 8-hour battery
2. **Water Guardian** ($699) - Auto shutoff valve + water quality sensors (TDS, turbidity)
3. **HVAC Sentinel** ($399) - Filter monitoring + UV-C pathogen control
4. **Air Sensors** ($169) - Room-by-room air quality
5. **Foundation Sensor** ($199) - 0.001° tilt detection, structural health
6. **Gas Guardian** ($149) - Methane + CO detection
7. **Leak Spots** ($69) - Point-of-use water detection

**Software:**
- Edge AI (XGBoost) runs on the hub - no cloud dependency for critical decisions
- Cross-sensor correlation predicts failures before they happen
- Tesla Fleet API integration for Powerwall coordination
- Insurance API for real-time risk scoring

**The Magic:**
Leak detected → Hub confirms (100ms) → Tesla API prioritizes sump pump (300ms) → Water valve closes (800ms) → Push notification sent (1000ms) → Insurance API logged (2000ms)

**Total response: <3 seconds.** Competitors take 30-60 seconds.

### WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?
1. **Hardware sales:** $799-3,999 per home (44-74% gross margin)
2. **Monitoring subscription:** $9.99-29.99/month
3. **Insurance API licensing:** $3-5/home/month from insurers
4. **Utility data licensing:** $50K-500K/year from utilities
5. **Contractor referrals:** $20/lead for HVAC, plumbing

### WHO ARE YOUR COMPETITORS?

| Competitor | What They Do | What We Do Better |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Ring/Nest | Cameras, doorbells | We monitor infrastructure, not burglars |
| Flo by Moen | Water shutoff only | Multi-hazard + Tesla + prediction |

- 2 patents filed (101 claims) on core technology
- Only Tesla Powerwall integration
- Only residential structural monitoring
- Only cross-sensor prediction (not just detection)
- Only full power-outage operation
- Founder actually understands construction

## OTHER

### WHAT CONVINCED YOU TO APPLY TO YC?
1. YC has funded 100+ hardware startups successfully
2. The network effect - intros to Tesla, investors, partners
3. Credibility for a non-traditional founder (contractor, not Stanford CS)
4. Speed - YC companies move fast, which matches my urgency

### WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY?
Tesla acquisition.

Tesla paid $2.6B for SolarCity (solar installation). NRG paid $2.8B for Vivint (security cameras + smart home). Amazon paid $1.2B for Ring (video doorbells).

Alexander One is the home intelligence layer that makes Tesla's energy ecosystem complete. We're building what Tesla needs but doesn't have: visibility into water, gas, and structural health coordinated with Powerwall.

With 600,000+ Powerwalls deployed and Tesla Insurance growing ($760M+ revenue), they need home risk data. We provide it.

**Alternative path:** If not Tesla, ADT, Resideo, Johnson Controls, or NRG would acquire us. The home protection data layer is valuable to anyone in energy or insurance.

### WHAT IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT OTHERS DON'T?
**Home disasters follow predictable patterns that cross sensor boundaries.**

A water leak doesn't just show up - first there's a pressure drop, then humidity rises, then condensation forms, then the pipe fails. This takes hours to days.

A foundation problem doesn't just appear - first there's a tilt change, then HVAC vibration patterns shift, then cracks form. This takes months to years.

Tech founders build single-sensor solutions (water OR gas OR security). I know from building and repairing homes that **disasters are multi-sensor events that can be predicted by correlating data streams.**

No one else is building the correlation engine. Everyone else is building point solutions.

### IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE US TO KNOW?
I'm a first-generation American, bilingual, self-made contractor who built a real business with real revenue and real margins. I'm not a privileged tech founder with a CS degree from Stanford.

What I have is domain expertise no software engineer has: I've physically built homes, fixed foundation problems, repaired water damage, and seen what fails. I know where to put sensors because I know where pipes run and where water pools.

I'm also a licensed contractor who can install these systems myself and train others - giving us a distribution advantage through contractor networks.

But more than that - I'm building this because I've lost family and carry scars from fires that technology could have prevented. Every home without proper monitoring is a family waiting for tragedy. I know because I've lived it four times.

The propane water heater that killed my brother's wife's grandmother? A $149 gas sensor would have saved her life. The stove fire that scarred my face? A $50 motion sensor with auto-shutoff. My grandmother's brother's 80% burns? Early detection would have given him time to escape.

Tesla's mission is "accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy." Preventing home disasters IS sustainable - fewer rebuilds, less waste, lower insurance costs, healthier buildings.

Alexander One isn't just a product. It's the protection my family never had. And I won't stop until every home has it.

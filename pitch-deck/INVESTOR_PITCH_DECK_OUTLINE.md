## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Header:** "American Homes Are Unprotected"

**Key Stats:**
- **$13 BILLION** - Annual water damage claims (93% preventable)
- **$84,000** - Average fire damage claim
- **2,600** - Americans killed by home fires annually
- **$50,000+** - Foundation repair costs

**The Failure:**
- Ring/Nest watch for burglars, not infrastructure
- Flo by Moen does water only, no coordination
- No system PREDICTS problems
- No system works during power outages

**Quote:** "Your home has vital signs. No one is monitoring them."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE BIGGER PROBLEM - TESLA'S BLIND SPOT

**Header:** "600,000 Powerwalls. Zero Home Intelligence."

**Visual:** Tesla Powerwall with question marks around it

**What Powerwall Knows:**
- Battery charge level
- Solar production
- Energy consumption
- Grid status

**What Powerwall Doesn't Know:**
- Is there a water leak?
- Is there a gas leak?
- Is the foundation settling?
- Is the HVAC failing?
- Is the air quality dangerous?

**The Opportunity:**
"Tesla built the battery. We build the brain that protects what's inside."

---

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION

**Header:** "Alexander One - Complete Home Intelligence"

**Visual:** System architecture diagram

**The Platform:**
- 7 sensor devices monitoring water, air, gas, HVAC, structure
- Central hub with edge AI (no cloud dependency)
- Tesla Fleet API integration
- Insurance data API

**The Magic:**
"When a leak is detected, we coordinate with Powerwall to keep sump pumps running while shutting off water. All in under 3 seconds."

**No one else does this.**

---

## SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS (Demo Slide)

**Header:** "The 3-Second Response"

**Visual:** Timeline graphic

```
T+0ms     → Leak sensor triggers
T+100ms   → Hub AI confirms (not false alarm)
T+300ms   → Tesla API: "Keep sump pump ON"
T+800ms   → Water valve: CLOSED
T+1000ms  → Phone notification sent
T+2000ms  → Insurance API logged

TOTAL: <3 SECONDS

Competitors: 30-60 seconds (if they respond at all)
```

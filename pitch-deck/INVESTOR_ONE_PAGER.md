### THE PROBLEM — $50 BILLION EXPOSED

Every 23 seconds, a fire department responds to a home fire in the U.S.

| Annual U.S. Losses | Cost |
|-------------------|------|
| Water damage | **$13 billion** |
| Fire damage | **$25 billion** |
| Gas incidents | **$2.4 billion** |
| Foundation failures | **$10+ billion** |

**93% of water damage is preventable.** Existing products detect problems after the damage starts. Alexander One prevents them before they happen.

---

### THE SOLUTION — UNDER 3 SECONDS

| Hazard | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Water leak detected | Valve closes in 800ms |
| Gas leak detected | Supply cut, fire dept alerted |
| Stove unattended | Graduated warnings → auto shutoff |
| Foundation shift | 0.001° tilt detection |
| HVAC degradation | Predicts failure before breakdown |

**Competitors respond in 30-60 seconds. We respond in under 3.**

### TRACTION

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Patents filed | 2 provisionals, 101 claims |
| Firmware | 508 lines, compiled, working |
| Hardware prototype | ESP32 + 5 sensor types integrated |
| Cloud connectivity | MQTT live |

### MARKET

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| Smart home devices | $154B by 2028 |
| IoT data monetization | $1T by 2034 |
| Insurance data licensing | $5B+ annually (140M U.S. homes) |
| Tesla Powerwall installed base | 600,000+ units |

### THIS PATH WORKS

| Company | Founder | Started | Exit |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| **Ring** | Jamie Siminoff | Garage, broke, rejected by Shark Tank | **$1.15B → Amazon** |
| **Nest** | Tony Fadell | Saw problem for 10 years, finally built it | **$3.2B → Google** |
| **Flo** | Halimi (father-son) | 8 years in garage, met Moen at CES | **Acquired → Moen** |

Flo reduced water damage claims by **96%**. Moen bought them.

Alexander One does what Flo does — plus fire, gas, foundation, and stove protection.

### THE ASK

**Raising:** $500K seed

| Use of Funds | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Working prototypes (both patents) | $150K |
| UL/FCC/ETL certification | $75K |
| OEM demo units for manufacturers | $100K |
| Travel — Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, Generac | $50K |
| Patent prosecution (provisional → full) | $25K |
| Legal, ops, runway | $100K |

**The play:** License to appliance manufacturers. They build it into every stove, water heater, generator. We collect royalties on millions of units.

Samsung sells 10M+ ranges/year. LG sells 8M+. Whirlpool sells 15M+.

**$2-5 royalty per unit = $50M-$150M annually.**

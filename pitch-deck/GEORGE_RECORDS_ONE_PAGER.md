## The $50 Billion Problem Nobody Has Solved

---

### THE PROBLEM

**Every 23 seconds**, a home fire department responds to a fire in the United States.

| Annual U.S. Losses | Cost |
|-------------------|------|
| Water damage claims | **$13 billion** |
| Fire damage claims | **$25 billion** |
| Gas leak incidents | **$2.4 billion** |
| Foundation failures | **$10+ billion** |

**93% of water damage is preventable.** Current solutions detect problems AFTER they happen. By then, the damage is done.

---

### THE SOLUTION

Alexander One predicts and prevents home disasters before they start.

**Response time: Under 3 seconds.** Competitors take 30-60 seconds.

| What We Detect | How We Respond |
|----------------|----------------|
| Water leak | Auto shutoff valve closes in 800ms |
| Gas leak | Cuts supply, alerts fire dept |
| Stove left on | Graduated warnings → auto shutoff |
| Foundation shift | 0.001° tilt detection, early warning |
| HVAC failure | Predicts breakdown before it happens |

---

### THE RESEARCH

- **6 months** of development
- **500+ hours** of solo research and engineering
- **101 patent claims** filed across 2 U.S. provisional patents
- **7 device specifications** fully documented
- **44-74% gross margins** on hardware (BOM finalized)

### THIS PATH WORKS

| Company | Founder | Started | Exit |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| **Ring** | Jamie Siminoff | Garage, broke, rejected by Shark Tank | **$1.15B → Amazon** |
| **Nest** | Tony Fadell | Saw problem for 10 years, finally built it | **$3.2B → Google** |
| **Flo** | Halimi (father-son) | 8 years in garage, met Moen at CES | **Acquired → Moen** |

Flo reduced water damage claims by **96%**. Moen bought them.

Alexander One does what Flo does — plus fire, gas, foundation, and stove protection.

### THE OPPORTUNITY

**Raising:** $500K seed

| Use of Funds | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Working prototypes (both patents) | $150K |
| UL/FCC/ETL certification | $75K |
| OEM demo units for manufacturers | $100K |
| Travel — Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, Generac | $50K |
| Patent prosecution (provisional → full) | $25K |
| Legal, ops, runway | $100K |

**The play:** License to appliance manufacturers. They build it into every stove, water heater, generator. We collect royalties on millions of units.

Samsung sells 10M+ ranges/year. LG sells 8M+. Whirlpool sells 15M+.

**$2-5 royalty per unit = $50M-$150M annually.**

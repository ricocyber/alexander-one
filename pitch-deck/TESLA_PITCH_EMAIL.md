# VERSION 1: COLD EMAIL TO TESLA ENERGY BD

**To:** [Tesla Energy Business Development]
**Subject:** Home Sensor Layer for Powerwall - The Data Tesla Doesn't Have

---

Hi,

Powerwall collects 240+ data points on energy. But Tesla is completely blind to:
- The $13 billion in annual water damage claims
- The gas leaks that cause explosions
- The foundation problems that destroy homes
- The HVAC failures that waste energy

**I've built Alexander One** - the home intelligence layer that fills this gap.

**What makes it different:**
- **Only system** with Tesla Fleet API integration
- **<3 second** emergency response (leak detected → Powerwall prioritizes sump pump → water shutoff)
- **Predicts failures** before they happen using cross-sensor AI
- **Insurance API** for real-time risk scoring (10-50% premium discounts)

I'm a licensed Oklahoma contractor who's built homes, repaired water damage, and seen what fails. I'm not guessing what homes need - I know.

NRG paid $2.8B for Vivint (security cameras). Alexander One is the infrastructure health layer that makes Powerwall a complete home protection system.

**I'd love 15 minutes to show you the demo.** I can demonstrate the Powerwall coordination sequence - it's the "holy shit" moment that no competitor can replicate.

Available anytime this week or next.

P.S. - I'm also applying to become a Tesla Certified Installer. Would love to discuss both the partnership and installer opportunities.

# VERSION 2: LINKEDIN MESSAGE (Short)

**To:** [Tesla Energy Product Manager / BD Person]
**Message:**

---

Hi [Name],

I've built a home sensor platform that integrates with Tesla Fleet API to coordinate emergency response with Powerwall.

When a water leak is detected, we:
1. Tell Powerwall to prioritize sump pump power
2. Shut off water main in <3 seconds
3. Log to insurance API

No other system does this. Powerwall has 600K+ installs but zero visibility into water, gas, or structural threats.

Would love to show you a 2-minute demo. Available for a quick call?

# VERSION 3: WARM INTRO REQUEST (To Send to Mutual Connection)

**To:** [Someone who knows Tesla people]
**Subject:** Intro request - Tesla Energy

---

Hey [Name],

I'm working on a smart home platform called Alexander One that's specifically designed to integrate with Tesla Powerwall. We're the only system that uses Tesla Fleet API to coordinate emergency response.

I'm looking for an intro to anyone at Tesla Energy - product, BD, partnerships, or even the Certified Installer program team.

The pitch: Powerwall is blind to water damage, gas leaks, and structural problems. We're the sensor layer that completes the home protection picture. NRG paid $2.8B for Vivint - the data layer for Tesla's energy ecosystem could be worth similar.

Would you be comfortable making an intro? I can send you a one-pager if helpful.

Thanks,
Eric

# VERSION 4: TESLA CERTIFIED INSTALLER FOLLOW-UP

**To:** Tesla Installer Program Team
**Subject:** Certified Installer Application + Partnership Opportunity

---

Hi,

I recently applied to the Tesla Certified Installer program (Oklahoma market). I'm a licensed general contractor (CIB #80007565) with $450K revenue in my first 8 months.

Beyond installation, I wanted to flag a potential partnership opportunity:

I've developed Alexander One - a home protection platform that integrates with Tesla Fleet API. When water leaks or gas hazards are detected, our system coordinates with Powerwall to:
- Prioritize critical loads (sump pumps)
- Maintain emergency response power
- Enable insurance premium discounts through real-time risk data

No other home protection system has Tesla integration. This could be valuable for:
1. **Powerwall differentiation** - "Complete home protection" vs just battery storage
2. **Tesla Insurance** - Real-time home risk data for underwriting
3. **Recurring revenue** - Monitoring subscriptions add to Powerwall ecosystem

Would love to discuss both my installer application and how Alexander One might fit into Tesla's energy ecosystem.

Best,
Eric "Riqoo" Deloera

# VERSION 5: TESLA INVESTOR DAY / EVENT PITCH (Elevator Pitch)

**60 seconds if you meet someone from Tesla at an event:**

---

"Hi, I'm Eric - I'm a licensed contractor from Oklahoma who built a smart home platform called Alexander One.

Here's the pitch: Powerwall knows everything about your energy but nothing about your water, gas, or structure. When a pipe bursts, Powerwall doesn't know. When the foundation settles, Powerwall doesn't know.

I built the sensor layer that fills that gap. And we integrate directly with Tesla Fleet API.

When a leak is detected, we tell Powerwall to keep the sump pump running while we shut off the water. All in under 3 seconds. No other system can do that.

NRG paid $2.8 billion for Vivint. The home intelligence layer for Tesla's ecosystem is worth at least that much.

Can I show you a 2-minute demo? [Pull out phone, show demo video]"

# KEY TALKING POINTS FOR ANY TESLA CONVERSATION

1. **The Blind Spot:** "Powerwall has 240+ energy data points but zero visibility into water, gas, or structural threats"

2. **The Integration:** "We're the only system using Tesla Fleet API for coordinated emergency response"

3. **The Speed:** "Less than 3 seconds from leak detection to water shutoff, while keeping sump pumps powered via Powerwall"

4. **The Comparison:** "NRG paid $2.8B for Vivint. We're building what Tesla actually needs - infrastructure health data, not security cameras"

5. **The Founder:** "I'm a licensed contractor who's built homes and repaired damage. I know exactly where sensors need to go because I know where pipes run and foundations fail"

6. **The Ask:** "15 minutes to demo the Powerwall coordination sequence"

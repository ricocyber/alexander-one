# ALEXANDER ONE
## How It Prevents Home Disasters

---

### THE PROBLEM

Most "smart home" systems only alert you AFTER damage starts. By then, it's too late.

- Average water damage claim: **$13,000**
- Average fire damage claim: **$84,000**
- Foundation repair: **$5,000 - $50,000**

---

### THE SOLUTION

**Alexander One is like a doctor for your house.**

Instead of waiting for something to break, it monitors your home's "vital signs" and predicts problems BEFORE they happen.

---

### HOW IT WORKS

**Water Leak Example:**

| Traditional System | Alexander One |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Pipe bursts | Detects pressure drop + humidity rising |
| Sensor gets wet | AI predicts leak DAYS before it happens |
| Alert sent | You fix pipe for $200 |
| You call plumber | IF pipe still bursts: valve closes in <3 seconds |
| **$13,000 damage** | **$0 damage** |

### THE SECRET: SENSORS THAT TALK TO EACH OTHER

Alexander One doesn't just have sensors - they communicate and find patterns:

| What Sensors Detect | What It Means |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Pressure drop + humidity spike | Pipe about to leak |
| Foundation tilt + vibration | House settling |
| Filter clog + energy spike | HVAC about to fail |
| Gas baseline drift | Appliance needs service |

**This is called cross-sensor AI prediction.**

### 3-SECOND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

When something DOES go wrong:

```
0.0 sec  →  Leak detected
0.1 sec  →  AI confirms (not false alarm)
0.3 sec  →  Tesla Powerwall keeps sump pump ON
0.8 sec  →  Water valve CLOSED
1.0 sec  →  Phone alert sent
2.0 sec  →  Insurance notified

TOTAL: UNDER 3 SECONDS
```

Competitors take 30-60 seconds. By then, your basement is flooded.

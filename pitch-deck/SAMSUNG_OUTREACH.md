# EMAIL 1: SMARTTHINGS PARTNERSHIP

**To:** partners@smartthings.com
**Subject:** Multi-Peril Home Protection Platform - Partnership Inquiry

---

I'm reaching out regarding integration partnership for Alexander One, a home disaster prevention platform with 2 US provisional patents (101 claims) covering multi-peril detection and automatic utility shutoff.

**What We Built:**

Unlike single-peril devices (Flo for water, Ting for electrical), Alexander One detects and responds to multiple hazards in under 3 seconds:

- Water leaks → automatic valve shutoff (800ms)
- Gas leaks → supply cut + emergency alert
- Fire/thermal anomalies → graduated response
- Foundation shift → 0.001° tilt detection
- HVAC degradation → predictive failure alerts

**Technical Stack:**

- ESP32-S3 microcontroller
- MLX90614 thermal sensor
- MQ-6 gas / MQ-2 smoke detection
- MQTT cloud connectivity
- Working firmware (compiled, tested)

**Why SmartThings:**

We want Alexander One to work natively within the SmartThings ecosystem. Integration would allow Samsung appliance owners to have comprehensive home protection that coordinates across devices.

**The Ask:**

A 15-minute call to discuss Works with SmartThings certification and potential deeper integration with Samsung home appliances.

I can share technical documentation, patent filings, and demo the working prototype.

Best regards,

# EMAIL 2: SAMSUNG NEXT VENTURES

**To:** sv.a@samsung.com
**Subject:** Alexander One - Multi-Peril Home Protection (2 Patents, 101 Claims)

---

Alexander One is a home disaster prevention platform that detects hazards and responds in under 3 seconds - fast enough to prevent damage, not just detect it.

**The Problem:**

$50 billion in annual US home damage. Current solutions (Flo, Ting, Nest Protect) each address one peril and respond in 30-60 seconds. By then, the damage is done.

**Our Solution:**

One platform covering water + fire + gas + foundation + HVAC with automatic shutoff in under 3 seconds.

**Intellectual Property:**

- US Provisional 63/934,524 (Dec 2025) - 20 claims - Smart Home + Energy Storage Coordination
- US Provisional 63/948,182 (Dec 2025) - 81 claims - AI-Powered Multi-Peril Detection
- Total: 101 patent claims protecting technology that doesn't exist elsewhere

**Market Validation:**

- Flo by Moen: 96% water claim reduction (acquired by Moen)
- Ting: 80% electrical fire prevention (State Farm deployed 1M+ units)
- Ring: $1.15B exit to Amazon
- Nest: $3.2B exit to Google

Alexander One is the multi-peril version of what they built.

**Business Model:**

Licensing to appliance manufacturers. Samsung builds our technology into appliances. We collect royalties per unit.

**The Ask:**

Exploring whether Samsung NEXT has interest in the smart home safety space. Open to investment discussion or strategic partnership.

Available for a call at your convenience.

Shane,

Building a multi-peril home protection platform with 101 patent claims covering automatic water/gas shutoff, fire detection, and foundation monitoring - responds in under 3 seconds.

Flo proved single-peril detection reduces insurance claims 96%. We cover multiple perils in one system.

Interested in licensing discussions with Samsung Home Appliances. Worth a conversation?

Yoonho,

Saw you're chairing the "When Everything Clicks: How Open Ecosystems Deliver Impactful AI" panel at CES.

I built Alexander One - a multi-peril home protection system (water, fire, gas, foundation) with 101 patent claims and sub-3-second response time. Looking for ecosystem partners.

Would welcome the chance to connect at CES or before. Interested in how Alexander One could integrate with the Home Connectivity Alliance vision.

# SAMSUNG OPEN INNOVATION APPLICATION

**Company Name:** PERGOLUXX CONSTRUCTION LLC

**Product Name:** Alexander One

**One-Line Description:**
Multi-peril home disaster prevention platform with 101 patent claims that responds in under 3 seconds to shut off water and gas when it detects leaks, fires, or hazards.

**Problem Statement:**
American homeowners lose $50 billion annually to preventable property damage. Current smart home devices (Flo, Ting, Nest) each cover one peril and respond in 30-60 seconds. No solution exists that covers multiple perils with response time fast enough to prevent damage.

**Solution:**
Alexander One detects water leaks, gas leaks, fire/thermal anomalies, foundation shifts, and HVAC degradation - responding with automatic utility shutoff in under 3 seconds.

**Technology:**
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller with multi-sensor fusion
- MLX90614 thermal, MQ-6 gas, MQ-2 smoke, PIR motion
- MQTT cloud connectivity
- Automatic valve control (800ms response)
- AI-powered pattern recognition

**Intellectual Property:**
- US Provisional 63/934,524 (20 claims) - Smart Home + Energy Coordination
- US Provisional 63/948,182 (81 claims) - AI-Powered Hazard Detection
- Total: 101 patent claims filed December 2025

**Samsung Integration Opportunity:**
License Alexander One technology for integration into Samsung ranges, refrigerators, washers, and HVAC systems. Every Samsung appliance becomes a safety device.

**Competitive Advantage:**
| Feature | Flo | Ting | Nest | Alexander One |
|---------|-----|------|------|---------------|
